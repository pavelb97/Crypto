# Crypto
A simple 'encryption' program. This program is part of a project for an online Java course I am taking on edX. 
The program is very simple - it accepts a string, condenses it into one long upper case string removing all whitespace and punctuation,
offsets the letters within the string by a given number (eg. 'ABC' offset by 2 becomes 'BCD') and groups the new sting by a given number. 
This project has helped me better understand how java methods, method calling and input parameters work.
It was also greatly helpful in getting used to the java syntax as I am relatively new to java.
